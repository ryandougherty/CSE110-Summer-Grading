CSE110SummerGrading
===================

Grading for the CSE110 Summer 2013 session.

If you're looking at this from the future, the code is somewhat old and outdated, so it may not be able to work. What this code did was parse a specific HTML file into a .txt file for each student with all of his/her grades in a list. Then the grade was computed based off that list, and all grades were written to a different txt file.
